# Msc. Platooning Project - 

This repository includes the code used for the implementations of the platooning project as well as its documentation.

## Search Method

The `search_algorithms` directory includes all the search algorithms implementation and some descriptions of how they work and that includes the naive solution.

## Other Experiments

1. The `GNN_VPP` is the directory holding the experiments on the *Vehicle Platooning Problem (VPP)* based on *Graph Neural Network (GNN)* using the [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/) package. The work on these experiment is discontinued.

2. The `ILP_VPP` is the current solution for the *VPP* using an *Integer Linear Programming (ILP)* approach, proposed by The [Institute for Informatics (IfI)](https://www.ifi.tu-clausthal.de/en/) of the TU Clausthal. This directory also includes the [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) database holding the road network data.

## Summary

The **Search Method** chapter is the main topic in the master's project and is discussed in details.
